# broadcasterServer

# initial app flow - test out peerjs
 `/broadcast` starts a stream of the client's web cam and sends the id to a database
 `/view` shows a list of all broadcasts going on.  Each list item contains a `<a>` tag to the specific broadcast
 `/view/:id` shows the video stream from the specified id.  
 This is the general idea.  Impliment using jquerymobile concepts.
